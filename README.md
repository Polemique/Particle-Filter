# Particle-Filter

Welcome to the Particle Filter for Video Stream Processing project! This repository contains an implementation of a particle filter algorithm designed for real-time video stream analysis. Particle filters are commonly used in computer vision and robotics for object tracking and localization in dynamic environments.

A Particle Filter is a probabilistic algorithm that estimates the state of a dynamic system by representing it with a set of particles. In the context of video stream processing, a particle filter can be employed to track and predict the movement of objects within a sequence of frames.
